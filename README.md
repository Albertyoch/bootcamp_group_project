# Bootcamp Group Projects 

Embarking on my data analytics journey, this repository marks the inception of my exploration. Originating from a small city in Indonesia, I initially found myself lacking proficiency in anything tech-related. Despite graduating with a Finance degree, I felt the need to augment my skills. Stepping out of my comfort zone, I enrolled in a fintech bootcamp at the University of Sydney, where my transformative journey unfolded.

Throughout this bootcamp, I delved into coding using Python, mastered its core libraries, delved into machine learning, and even ventured into solidity, the programming language for cryptocurrency smart contracts.

Aligned with the curriculum, these projects serve as a testament to our team's growth and collaborative efforts. What made this experience truly enriching was the unwavering support and intelligence of my team, offering guidance and new insights during our collaborative sessions.
